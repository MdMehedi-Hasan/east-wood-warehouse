## Eastwood app introduction
Eastwood is a furniture based warehouse app where we are focusing on admin panel alike interactivity. In the home page we have added required section & three extra sections partners,business values & about us (as per our resource we have found people are using these section in warehouse websites. So we also added them). If you click manage button from a single inventory it will show details about that product and the route will allow you to reduce or increse stock quantity. Also you will find a manage inventory button bottom of the inventory section which will navigate you to manage inventory page. In this page you can see product image,name,stock,price $ a delete button. Clicking on that button will completely delete the product from database also from UI.Below you will find another button which is called add new item will navigate you to the add new page where you can add any product to the database and the product will show in both manage inventory and myitems. We do have to more nav for blogs and log in. In blogs section we have answered the question which were asked for assignment.
